# digit-recognition

A mathematical description and implementation for a neural net classifier. A Pygame application for drawing numbers and making predictions with the model is provided for testing purposes. 

**Usage**: hold down the left mouse-click to start drawing on the window. Press space-bar to clear the window and display your model's prediction. 

The theory behind the implementation is provided in theory/neural_network.pdf or at https://www.overleaf.com/read/pmmpbrkcbssm
